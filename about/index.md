When I began using computers, I was intrigued to understand what was behind the graphical user interface. Since then, I have been on a continuous journey to learn the theory behind computers, the methodology of how they work, and to further my computer science knowledge. Through this, I discovered my passion for creating clean, user‐friendly software applications.\
\
I have gained a significant level of knowledge of how computers work, the theory behind them and why we need computer scientists in the working world. Studying Computer Science at the University of Regina has increased my knowledge, as well as my desire to want to learn more about this subject. To be successful as a student, I have found it is important to be organised, capable of independent research, and to have both written and verbal communication skills. However, it is also very important in computer science to be able to analyse problems and work out solutions, and to program these solutions to meet user’s needs if there is a gap in the market.\
\
I am now familiar and competent with C/C++, JavaScript, HTML5/CSS3, PHP, AJAX, JQuery, SQL/MySQL, Node.js, Express.js, and MongoDB. I have also learned how to work in several operating systems such as UNIX, LINUX and Windows. I have advanced my programming skills to develop my own software applications, and further understand programming techniques including object orientated programming, and the methods of Agile and Scrum.\
\
The work of computer scientists' helps to ensure that current computer programs and processes are maintained and updated when appropriate. I am always searching for programs or websites to advance my skills and knowledge, such as using GitHub as a version control system for my project. I have also taken part in projects that have enabled me to draw on all my previous knowledge and experience at university, and this has furthered my ability to work independently to create a substantial finished product for an external client. With this knowledge I feel that my problem solving has developed through my projects, which I keep up to date on this page. I enjoy all challenges and experiences of project work - not only through the programming, but also within the process from analysis to testing.
